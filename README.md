# Single-cell RNA-seq Analysis Pipeline
# Author: Geoff Dilly

This repository contains:
- A bash script (install.sh) to install this pipeline in a local directory
- R scripts to process 10x scRNA samples for Seurat and DESEQ2 analysis
- R scripts to generate plots to identify cell clusters in a Seurat object
- An R configuration file and metadata CSV for setting analysis parameters and identifying samples
- A Bash script to run the R scripts in the correct order (which is editable)
- The necessary file structure for this analysis pipeline

This pipeline may be used for future publications from the Messing Lab at UT Austin
